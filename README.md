## What this Website Consists of

This website was created using 

1. the yarn package manager to hold all of the extraneous packages we need for this project, including React, React-Components, etc... 
2. vite.js for a lightweight framework to handle debugging features such as Hot Reload! 
3. React, a common JS framework for modularizing portions of your web project while providing a simple abstraction to handle events and hooks
4. React-Components, which allows you to embed components with CSS directly within the .jsx files 

## How to Run this Website 

1. 'cd' into the original project 
2. Make sure all node packages are downloaded, so run either 'npm install' or 'yarn add' (by default I use yarn, so use that unless you plan on changing the package manager to npm...)  
3. run 'yarn run dev', which should host the 'index.html' on a web server (port 5173 by default)


### Professionalism/View

This website/landing page is meant to be an amalgamation of my step by step goals to achieve a mastery in philosophy. The page does not feature the "best" UI design, nor was it meant to.
